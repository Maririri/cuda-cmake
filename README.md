# CUDA-CMake

### Project Overview
Example project that demonstrates how to use the new CUDA functionality built into CMake.

Developed with CMake 3.14, CUDA 9.2 or 10.1, Visual Studio 2017 (Windows 10), and GCC 7.4 (Ubuntu 18.04).

Note that the CMake modules located in the *cmake/* subdir are actually from
my [cmake-common](https://github.com/stephen-sorley/cmake-common) project.
They've been pulled into this project as a subrepo by using
[git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo/tree/master).


### Third-party dependencies

[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads):
High-performance computing library for Nvidia graphics cards.
